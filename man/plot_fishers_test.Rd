\usage{
plot_fishers_test(pooling_test)
}
\arguments{
\item{pooling_test}{Raw output from \code{\link[=fishers_test]{fishers_test()}}.}
}
\value{
A plot faceted by each test. Each facet shows:
\itemize{
\item a histogram of locus-specific p-values
\item the overall p-value across loci printed in red
\item a horizontal red line showing the expected number of loci within each p-value bin by chance
}
}
\description{
This function plots the results from \code{\link[=fishers_test]{fishers_test()}}. It displays a histogram of locus-specific p-values and
the overall p-value across loci, faceted by each test.
}
\details{
This function is used to visualize the results from \code{\link[=fishers_test]{fishers_test()}}, which is used to test whether temporally or geographically similar
baseline collections have significant differences in allele frequencies across loci. If there are no significant differences between collections
(overall p-value across loci > 0.01), then we typically pool collections into populations to improve estimates of allele frequencies. However,
it can also be helpful to see the distribution of locus-specific p-values to determine if there are just a few loci driving the overall p-value, or
if there are several loci that have low p-values.

While testing for homogeneity of allele frequencies is not the same as testing for conformance to Hardy-Weinberg expectations,
the idea for the plots created by this function comes from:
