Here is a summary of your R instance, package version, etc. This is simply a record of which version of the GCLr package/R was used for QC. 
```{r}
`%>%` <- magrittr::`%>%` #grab tidy pipe

info <- sessioninfo::session_info(info = "auto")

info$platform

info$packages %>% dplyr::filter(package == "GCLr")
```

# Intro

This is an R markdown template for QC. The template is split into two parts, 1) Project Data Analysis and 2) QC Analysis. 

The first section is a spot where lab staff can examine project data and make sure it looks good prior QC. The second section is the full QC analysis and occurs after completion of a project but prior to importing data.

Once loaded, you simply save the file in the QC directory, fill in a few inputs at the start, then run the code and it will generate a QC summary html.

# Background
The previous QC consisted of an R script with Excel and other outputs, this exports everything in a single interactive html notebook. The purpose is to keep the QC analysis and results together, in a more reproducible format, while allowing for exporting to Excel, if necessary.


# Script Directions/Notes
    
    1) Add a title and your name to the top of the script.
    2) Save this to the QC directory. Recommended naming convention: "project#_QC.Rmd". Example: S200_QC.Rmd
    3) Run this script in order, one code chunk at a time, or some functions will not provide accurate results. This is by design, as this script only hits LOKI once to save time.
    4) Add your review notes to the file (in the relevant project or QC review section), prior to finalizing (i.e., saving)!

# Inputs
Now we can move onto required user inputs.
*This is the only spot where you need to enter information!*
```{r inputs}
dirqc <- "" # The directory where the QC files are located.

species <- "" # The species for the project (e.g., "pink"). Note this is lower case.

project <- "" # The project name (e.g., "P014").

project_type <- "" # The type of project ("TaqMan", "uSat", or "GT-seq").
```

# Optional inputs
Here are a few more inputs, but are optional and should probably remain the defaults (i.e., do not change unless you know what you are doing.)
```{r optional_input}
username <- readLines(con = "//DFGANCRDC01.dfg.alaska.local/Genetics/Anchorage/Analysis/R files/usr.pw")[1] # LOKI username 
.password <- readLines(con = "//DFGANCRDC01.dfg.alaska.local/Genetics/Anchorage/Analysis/R files/usr.pw")[2] # LOKI password

qc_summary_file <- paste("Project", project,"QC Summary R Script.xlsx") # The file path for the QC summary file; This is automatically generated using `project` (i.e., don't change unless you know what you're doing).

conflict_rate <- 0.10 # The conflict rate threshold at which dupcheck between sillys occurs (default is 0.10).
```

*Those were all of the user inputs/modifiable sections. The remainder of the script is set up to be run, in order, line by line. Please do not change anything, unless you know what you're doing. Further, if changes are required, it may be worth updating the template so it's fixed for everyone.*


# Notebook prep
This is for notebook set up. Do not change.
```{r knitprep, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  root.dir = dirqc, # set the working directory to dirqc for all subsequent chunks!
  fig.pos = '!h',    # Place figures here and don't float
  fig.width = 12     # Set figure width
)
```

This is a function for making the tables look nice. Do not change.
```{r formatfun}
qc_table <- function(x, page.length = NULL){ 
  
  cols <- names(x)
  
  dbl <- x %>% 
    type.convert(as.is = TRUE) %>% 
    dplyr::summarize(dplyr::across(all_of(cols), is.double)) %>% 
    unlist()

  
  DT::datatable(data = x,
    rownames = FALSE,
    filter = "top",
    extensions = "Buttons",
    options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip',
                   pageLength = page.length,
                   buttons =
                     list(
                       'copy',
                       'print',
                       list(
                         extend = 'collection',
                         buttons = c('csv', 'excel'),
                         text = 'Download')))
  ) %>% 
    DT::formatRound(columns = dbl, digits = 3)
    
  }
```




# Project Data Analysis
This is the start of the project data QC. Here, you'll examine project fish and determine if the project was a success! By the end of this section, you should have a good handle on whether there were issues with the project. From there you can stop and fix issues, select QC fish to run, or carry on with the QC if you already have those data. 

## Read Project Genotypes
The first step is to read in the project genotypes from LOKI.

```{r project_genos}
GCLr::loki2r_proj(project_name = project, username = username, password = .password)
  
rm(.password) #ditch password since no longer needed

loci <- LocusControl$locusnames # grab list of loci for use later
```

## Calculate Failure Rate
Now we can calculate the failure rate of the project.
```{r fail_rate}
failure_rate <- GCLr::failure_rate(sillyvec = project_sillys)  
```

### Failure Rate by Silly
This is a table showing the failure rate by silly for the project.
```{r fail_rate_silly_table}
failure_rate$silly_failure_rate %>% 
  qc_table() %>% 
  DT::formatStyle('fail', backgroundColor = DT::styleInterval(0.04, c('white', 'yellow')))
```

And here is a plot showing those data. 
```{r fail_rate_silly_plot}
failure_rate$plot_silly_failure_rate
```


### Failure Rate by Locus
This is the failure rate by locus for the project.
```{r fail_rate_locus}
failure_rate$locus_failure_rate %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(fail)) %>% 
  qc_table() %>%
  DT::formatStyle('fail', backgroundColor = DT::styleInterval(0.04, c('white', 'yellow')))
```

### Failure Rate by Plate
This is a table showing the failure rate by plate for the project.
```{r fail_rate_plate_table}
failure_rate$plate_failure_rate %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(fail)) %>% 
  qc_table() %>%
  DT::formatStyle('fail', backgroundColor = DT::styleInterval(0.04, c('white', 'yellow')))
```                               

And here is a plot showing those data. 
```{r fail_rate_plate_plot}
failure_rate$plot_plate_failure_rate
```

### Overall Failure Rate
This is the overall failure rate for the project.
```{r fail_rate_overall}
failure_rate$overall_failure_rate %>% 
  qc_table()
```

## Sample Sizes by Locus
We'll calculate the sample sizes, by locus, for project genotypes.

```{r samp_size_locus}
original_proj_n_by_locus <- GCLr::sampn_by_locus(sillyvec = project_sillys, loci = loci)

original_proj_n_by_locus %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(names_to = "locus", values_to = "n",-silly) %>% 
  qc_table()
```


## Project QA checks
The next step is to conduct QA of the project. This ensures that we don't have any hidden, or otherwise lurking, bad data. 

### n genotyped
First calculate the number of fish that were genotyped
```{r samp_size}
project_sillys_n <- tibble::tibble(silly = project_sillys) %>% 
   dplyr::mutate(genotyped = GCLr::silly_n(sillyvec = project_sillys) %>% dplyr::pull(n))

project_sillys_n  %>% 
  qc_table()# view sample size table
```

### Alternate Species
Now, we'll check for alternate species. Note that this is only done for chum and sockeye and if there are certain markers in the markersuite. Otherwise, NA is added to the sample size table. 

The purpose of this plot is to show a summary a few markers that are indicative of an incorrect species. Specifically, there are informative "failure" and "alternate" markers that can be used to determine if a "sockeye" is actually chum or a "chum" is a sockeye. The failure markers are informative because they fail for one of the species. Similarly, alternate markers can be informative because they exhibit a different (i.e., alternate) genotype. The plot shows a summary of the proportions of these failure and alternate markers identified for each fish. For example, a sockeye that is actually a chum may show up as 5/5 (proportion = 1) alternate markers and it may fail for 6/6 (proportion = 1) failure markers. Or it could have alternate genotype in 4/5 cases (proportion = 0.8) and failure in 5/6 (proportion = 0.83333) cases, which would still be a strong indicator that it is not sockeye. 

*Note, we're not removing these fish as you would during a normal project (i.e., GCLr::remove_alt_species), as they may be helpful in resolving conflicts. It's also important to note that the sample size is calculated based on assumed defaults, please read the sample size calculation commentary below for details.* 


**XXX -Maybe highlight circles that are likely alternates? could do this using the cutoff values**

```{r alt_spp}
# only run if spp = chum or sockeye and the loci are in the list, otherwise nothing to check
if (any(species %in% c("chum", "sockeye")) &
    any(loci %in% c("Oke_U1018-50", "Oke_U2032-74", "Oke_Cr386", "Oke_AhR1-78", "Oke_CKS1-94", "Oke_e2ig5-50", "Oke_U1002-262", "Oke_U1025-135",
        "Oke_u200-385", "Oke_U2025-86", "Oke_U502-241", "One_ctgf-301", "One_KCT1-453", "One_taf12-248", "One_U1013-108", "One_U1214-107", "One_Hsp47", "One_STC-410", "One_U1010-81", "One_MHC2_190", "One_cin-177", "One_vatf-214"))
    ) {
  
  # run alternate species checks
  alternate_spp <-
    suppressMessages(GCLr::find_alt_species(sillyvec = project_sillys, species = species))
  
  # since we're not removing these fish, we must manually calculate the number of alternates. Important to note that we're using a 0.5 cutoff for alternate and failure, as this is the default for GCLr::remove_alt_species(). Any desired changes to the defaults need to be reflected here!
  
  alt_indivs <- alternate_spp %>% 
                    dplyr::mutate(alternate = dplyr::case_when(failure > 0.5 & alternate > 0.5 ~ TRUE,
                                                        TRUE ~ FALSE))
  
  n_alts <- alt_indivs %>%
                    tidyr::separate(silly_fish, into = c("silly", "fishID")) %>% 
                    dplyr::group_by(silly) %>% 
                    dplyr::summarize(wrong_spp = sum(alternate))
  
  project_sillys_n <- project_sillys_n %>%
    dplyr::left_join(n_alts, by = "silly")
                     
} else {
  # update sample size table with NA if does not meet species or loci criteria
  project_sillys_n <- project_sillys_n %>%
    dplyr::mutate(wrong_spp = NA_integer_)
}

```

 Check out sample size table:

```{r samp_size_alts}
project_sillys_n  %>% 
  qc_table()# view sample size table
```

Here we can view the table containing failed and alternate markers for each fish. This table shows the proportion of 'failure' and 'alternate' indicator markers that were found for each fish. These data are what's used to determine whether a chum or sockeye was incorrectly identified. 

```{r alt_spp_table}
if (!species %in% c("sockeye", "chum")) {
  message("Only applicable for chum and sockeye")
}else{
  alternate_spp %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(desc(failure)) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(desc(alternate)) %>% 
    qc_table()
}

```


### Missing (80% rule)
Check for individuals missing \>=20% of genotypes (i.e. the 80% rule). 

*Note that we are removing fish here, since they have poor quality data and are not useful in resolving conflicts.*
```{r miss_loci}
MissLoci <- GCLr::remove_ind_miss_loci(sillyvec = project_sillys, proportion = 0.8, loci = loci)

project_sillys_n <- project_sillys_n %>%
    dplyr::mutate(missing =  genotyped - GCLr::silly_n(sillyvec = project_sillys) %>% dplyr::pull(n))
```

Check out the sample size table, after removing the fish with poor quality data
```{r samp_size_miss}
project_sillys_n %>% 
  qc_table() # view sample size table
```


### Duplicate check.

Remove duplicate individuals within the same collection. Typically we specify duplicates as a pair of individuals that share \>=95% of genotypes. 

*Note that for QC purposes we are not removing any fish, just noting how many per silly. We need to retain all fish, as they may be helpful in resolving conflicts later.*

```{r dupcheck}
# Run dup check within silly
dup_check_95_minproportion <-
  GCLr::dupcheck_within_silly(
    sillyvec = project_sillys,
    loci = loci,
    quantile = NULL,
    minproportion = 0.95,
    minnonmissing = 0.6,
    ncores = 4,
    LocusCtl = LocusControl
  )

# View dups
dup_check_95_minproportion

#calculate the number of duplicates. First check if the dup check object is 0, and stop there, otherwise, continue and calculate the number of duplicates as the number of unique ID's found in the duplicate check function above. 

if (nrow(dup_check_95_minproportion) == 0) {

  n_dups <- tibble::tibble(silly = project_sillys, duplicate = 0) #no duplicates if this object is empty

} else{

  n_dups <- dup_check_95_minproportion %>%
        dplyr::mutate(
          remove = dplyr::case_when(
            Missing1 > Missing2 ~ ID1,
            Missing2 > Missing1 ~ ID2,
            Missing1 == Missing2 ~ ID1
          )
        ) %>%
        dplyr::distinct(silly, remove) %>% 
        dplyr::group_by(silly) %>% 
        dplyr::summarise(duplicate = length(remove))

 

}

project_sillys_n <- project_sillys_n %>%
  dplyr::left_join(n_dups, by = "silly") %>% 
  tidyr::replace_na(replace = list(duplicate = 0))
  
  
```

Check out the sample size table, after checking for duplicates
```{r samp_size_dups}
project_sillys_n %>% 
  qc_table() # view sample size table
```

### Final Sample Size
This table shows the final sample size for each silly:
```{r samp_size_final}
project_sillys_n <- project_sillys_n %>%
    dplyr::mutate(final = genotyped - wrong_spp - missing - duplicate)


# view sample size table
qc_table(project_sillys_n)

```

This concludes the QA section. At this point, you should have all the information necessary to decide if there are issues with the project extractions! 

# Select QC Fish
Now that a project has been vetted and you're happy with it, you can select high-quality fish for QC analysis. The function below ignores any duplicates, low quality, or wrong species, leaving a subset of high-quality fish. Using high quality fish ensures that there will be power during the QC. 
*XXX Andy's new function should replace "sample" here.*
```{r}
if (select.list( choices = c("Yes", "No"), preselect = "No", multiple = FALSE, title = "Select QC fish now?", graphics = TRUE) == "Yes") {
  print("Selecting the highest quality fish that you've ever seen... ")
  qc_fish <- sample(100)
} else{
  print("Not selecting QC fish at this time.")
  qc_fish <- NA_integer_
}

qc_fish
```


# Project Data Analysis Summary
This is a good spot to interpret the results above and provide a summary of the project data. Specifically, how did it look, did you notice anything odd, are you continuing with QC, did you select QC fish, etc.

    Name:
    Date:
    Comments:



**At this point, you can simply save the file and exit or continue onto the QC data analysis section.**

# QC Data Analysis
This is the start of the QC data analysis. Here, you'll examine QC fish and compare those with project fish. By the end of this section, you should have a good handle on whether there were issues with the project. Note that you need to run the `Project Data Analysis` section above to generate some of the required objects. 

Pro-tip: click here, wait no here (I kid, anywhere around here works...), and press `control + alt + shift + p` on your keyboard to "run all chunks above". This will automatically run all of the code above your cursor. *This should only be done if you've already gone through the project section.*

## Read in QC Genotypes
Move onto the QC genotypes now. 
    
```{r qc_genos}
qc_files <-
  list.files(path = "Genotype Data Files", pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE, recursive = FALSE)

if (project_type %in% c("TaqMan", "uSat","GT-seq")) {
  GCLr::read_qc_geno(qc_csv_filepaths = qc_files, type = project_type)
} else {
  message("project_type must be either 'TaqMan', 'uSat', or' GT-seq' to read in qc genotypes")
}

qc_sillys_n <- GCLr::silly_n(sillyvec = qc_sillys)

qc_sillys_n
```
    
## Read in Conflict Report
Now read in the conflict report. 
*Note - old conflict reports have "0" for mitochondrial conflicts while the new has " " for mitochondrial conflicts, we will refer to them as "Homo-Homo".*
```{r concordance_files}
qc_concordance_report_file <- list.files(path = "Conflict Reports", pattern = "ConcordanceReport", full.names = TRUE)

qc_concordance_report_file #verify it found the file(s)! If this is empty, it will not work.

GCLr::combine_conflicts(files = qc_concordance_report_file)
```

### Conflict Summaries
The next step is to summarize the conflicts. This will be done a few ways - by plate, by silly, and by loci - which should cover all types of issues you may encounter. 

#### By plate
First, we'll take a look at the number of conflicts by plate:
```{r conflict_plate}
conflicts_by_plate <- combined_conflicts %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(plate_id, concordance_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .groups = "keep" ) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "concordance_type", values_from = "n",values_fill = 0, names_expand = TRUE) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(Conflict = sum(`Het-Het`, `Het-Homo`, `Homo-Het`, `Homo-Homo`)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()

conflicts_by_plate %>%
  qc_table() %>% 
  DT::formatStyle('Homo-Homo', backgroundColor = DT::styleInterval(0.00, c('white', 'yellow')))
```

#### By SILLY
Next, we'll look at the number of conflicts by silly code.
```{r conflict_silly}
conflicts_by_silly <- combined_conflicts %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(silly, concordance_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .groups = "keep" ) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "concordance_type",values_from = "n", values_fill = 0, names_expand = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Conflict = sum(`Het-Het`, `Het-Homo`, `Homo-Het`, `Homo-Homo`)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()

conflicts_by_silly %>% 
  qc_table() %>% 
  DT::formatStyle('Homo-Homo', backgroundColor = DT::styleInterval(0.00, c('white', 'yellow')))
```

#### By locus
Finally, we can look at the number of conflicts by locus.
```{r conflict_locus}
conflicts_by_locus <- combined_conflicts %>%
  dplyr::group_by(locus, concordance_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .groups = "keep" ) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "concordance_type",values_from = "n", values_fill = 0, names_expand = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Conflict = sum(`Het-Het`, `Het-Homo`, `Homo-Het`, `Homo-Homo`)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()

conflicts_by_locus %>% 
  qc_table() %>% 
  DT::formatStyle('Homo-Homo', backgroundColor = DT::styleInterval(0.00, c('white', 'yellow')))
```

## Sample Sizes by Locus
We'll calculate the sample sizes, by locus, for qc genotypes.
*Note - you will not get output from this section unless something fails (i.e., below 0.8). If there are failures, you'll see a list of loci, by silly*

```{r qc_reruns}
original_qc_n_by_locus <-
  GCLr::sampn_by_locus(sillyvec = qc_sillys, loci = loci)

# tibble showing percentage for each locus
original_qc_percent_by_locus <- original_qc_n_by_locus %>%
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(across(all_of(loci), ~ . / max(dplyr::c_across(dplyr::all_of(loci)), na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -silly, names_to = "loci", values_to = "percent") %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = silly, values_from = percent)

# Are any of these below 80% (i.e., need to be re-run)?
rerunsqc <- which(apply(original_qc_percent_by_locus, 2, min) < 0.8)

# only show results if any of them are below 0.8  i.e., need to be rerun
if (any(original_qc_percent_by_locus %>%
        dplyr::summarize(dplyr::across(dplyr::everything(), ~ any(. < 0.8))))) {
  print(
    dplyr::select(
      original_qc_percent_by_locus,
      "loci",
      tidyselect::where(~ any(.x < 0.8))
    ) %>%
      dplyr::filter(dplyr::if_any(
        tidyselect::starts_with(qc_sillys), ~ . < 0.8
      ))
  )
  
}

```


Now let's check out a quick plot. This plot is interactive, so you can easily see what's going on - it allows you to zoom, hover over points for info, move around the plot, etc.

```{r plot_successrate}
plot.dat <- original_qc_percent_by_locus %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(values_to = "percent", names_to = "silly", -loci)

plotly::ggplotly(
  plot.dat %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = silly, y = loci)) +
  ggplot2::geom_tile(ggplot2::aes(fill = percent), color = "white") +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient(
    low = "black",
    high = "white",
    aesthetics = "fill",
    limits = c(0,1),
    breaks = seq(0,1, 0.25),
    guide = ggplot2::guide_colorbar(nbin = 100)  # Show a gradient colorbar legend
  ) +
   (if(min(plot.dat$percent)<0.8){
     
     ggplot2::geom_tile(data = . %>% dplyr::filter(percent < 0.8), fill = "red" , height = 1) 
     
   })
  +
    ggplot2::ggtitle("Percent genotyped by silly/locus\nNote:red bars indicate loci with genotype sucess less than 80%") +
    ggplot2::labs(fill = "Percent\ngenotyped") +
    ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 90))
)
```


## QC QA checks
The next step is to conduct QA of the QC extractions. We're not calculating the full sample sizes, etc., as shown above, simply dealing with missing loci (looking for no more than 20% loss). This ensures that we don't have any hidden, or otherwise lurking, bad data. 

### Missing (80% rule)
```{r qc_rm_miss}
miss_loci_qc <- GCLr::remove_ind_miss_loci(sillyvec = qc_sillys, proportion = 0.8)
```
  
### Duplicate check on high conflict individuals
The last step in the process is to perform a duplicate check on any individuals which show a high degree of conflicts.
```{r qc_conflict_rate}
# Filter for conflicts, determine conflict rate
conflicts <- combined_conflicts %>%
  dplyr::filter(concordance_type %in% c("Het-Het", "Het-Homo", "Homo-Het", "Homo-Homo")) %>%
  dplyr::count(SillySource) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(p = n / length(loci)) 

# Plot a histogram of conflict rate
if(nrow(conflicts)>0){
  
  plot <- conflicts %>%
  janitor::tabyl(p) %>% 
  dplyr::bind_rows(tibble::tibble(p = NA, n = 2, percent = NA)) %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(y = n, x = p)) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) unique(floor(pretty(seq(0, (max(x) + 1) * 1.1)))))+
  ggplot2::geom_bar(position = ggplot2::position_dodge2(preserve = "single"), width = .01, stat = "identity") + 
  ggplot2::xlim(0, 1) +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = conflict_rate,
                      colour = "red",
                      lwd = 1.5) +
  ggplot2::xlab("Conflict Rate") +
  ggplot2::ylab("Frequency") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0("QC Individual Conflict Rate\n Note the red line is set to: ", conflict_rate))
  
}else{plot <- "There were no conflicts."}

suppressWarnings(print(plot)) 
```


Now identify anything to investigate by running a duplicate check on anything with high degree of conflicts
```{r qc_dupcheck}

(dup_check_results <- GCLr:::dupcheck_qc_conflicts(conflicts = conflicts, conflict_rate = conflict_rate, project_sillys = project_sillys))

```

We can take a look at the duplicate check results. Note that if the section above notes that there are no individuals with > 10% loci with conflicts between project and qc, this table will say "Not applicable".
```{r dup_check_view}
dup_check_results %>% 
  qc_table()
```


This concludes the QA section. At this point, you should have all the information necessary to decide if there are issues with the QC extractions! 



# Summary Tables
Now that we've ensured the project and qc data match, after accounting for unreliable individuals, we can generate summary tables of the results. There are a series of tables, all displaying different data that were calculated above. 


## Summary By Silly
Here is a table that shows an overall summary, by silly, for the project.
                                         
```{r summ_by_silly}
qc_sillys_n <- qc_sillys_n %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(silly = gsub(pattern = "*qc", replacement = "", x = silly))
  
summary_by_silly <-
  project_sillys_n %>%
  dplyr::left_join(failure_rate$silly_failure_rate, by = "silly") %>%
  dplyr::rename(`Failure Rate` = fail) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(qc_sillys_n, by = "silly") %>% 
  dplyr::rename(`Total qc Fish` = n)

summary_by_silly %>% 
  qc_table()
```

## Conflicts by Silly
Here is a table that shows the conflicts, by silly, for the project.
```{r conf_by_silly}
qc_silly_genotypes <- 
  tibble::tibble(silly = project_sillys) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(qc_sillys_n %>%
                     dplyr::mutate(silly = stringr::str_remove(silly, pattern = "qc$")),
                   by = "silly") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(qc_genotypes = dplyr::case_when(is.na(n) ~ 0,
                                     TRUE ~ n) *
                  length(loci)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-n)
                
                 
conflicts_by_silly_qc <- conflicts_by_silly %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(names_to = "type", values_to = "number",-silly) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(qc_silly_genotypes, by = "silly") %>%  # join number of qc genotypes by silly
  dplyr::mutate(rate = number / qc_genotypes) %>%  # conflict numbers to rates
  tidyr::pivot_longer(names_to = "variable", values_to = "value",cols = -c("silly","qc_genotypes","type")) %>%  # make tall
  tidyr::unite(temp, type, variable) %>%  # unite conflict type with both number and rate
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "temp",values_from = "value") %>%  # make wide
  dplyr::select(
    Silly = silly,
    "Total qc Genotypes" = qc_genotypes,
    "Total Discrepancies" = Conflict_number,
    "Discrepancy Rate" = Conflict_rate,
    "DB Zeros" = `DB Zero_number`,
    "DB Zero Rate" = `DB Zero_rate`,
    "qc Zeros" = `File Zero_number`,
    "qc Zero Rate" = `File Zero_rate`,
    "Total Het-Het" = `Het-Het_number`,
    "Het-Het Rate" = `Het-Het_rate`,
    "Total Het-Homo" = `Het-Homo_number`,
    "Het-Homo Rate" = `Het-Homo_rate`,
    "Total Homo-Het" = `Homo-Het_number`,
    "Homo-Het Rate" = `Homo-Het_rate`,
    "Total Homo-Homo" = `Homo-Homo_number`,
    "Homo-Homo Rate" = `Homo-Homo_rate`
  )

conflicts_by_silly_qc %>% 
  qc_table()
```

## Conflicts by Locus
Here is a table that shows the conflicts by locus for the project.
```{r conf_by_locus}
conflicts_by_locus_qc <- conflicts_by_locus %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(names_to = "type", values_to = "number", -locus) %>%  # make tall
  dplyr::mutate(qc_genotypes = sum(qc_sillys_n %>% 
                                     dplyr::pull(n))) %>%  # join number of qc genotypes by locus
  dplyr::mutate(rate = number / qc_genotypes) %>%  # conflict numbers to rates
  tidyr::pivot_longer(names_to = "variable", values_to = "value",cols = -c("locus","qc_genotypes","type")) %>% 
  tidyr::unite(temp, type, variable) %>%  # unite conflict type with both number and rate
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "temp",values_from = "value") %>%  # make wide
  dplyr::select(
    Locus = locus,
    "Total qc Genotypes" = qc_genotypes,
    "Total Discrepancies" = Conflict_number,
    "Discrepancy Rate" = Conflict_rate,
    "DB Zeros" = `DB Zero_number`,
    "DB Zero Rate" = `DB Zero_rate`,
    "qc Zeros" = `File Zero_number`,
    "qc Zero Rate" = `File Zero_rate`,
    "Total Het-Het" = `Het-Het_number`,
    "Het-Het Rate" = `Het-Het_rate`,
    "Total Het-Homo" = `Het-Homo_number`,
    "Het-Homo Rate" = `Het-Homo_rate`,
    "Total Homo-Het" = `Homo-Het_number`,
    "Homo-Het Rate" = `Homo-Het_rate`,
    "Total Homo-Homo" = `Homo-Homo_number`,
    "Homo-Homo Rate" = `Homo-Homo_rate`
  )

conflicts_by_locus_qc %>% 
  qc_table()
```

# QC Data Analysis Summary
This is a good spot to interpret the results above and provide a summary of the QC. Specifically, how did it look, did you notice anything odd, etc.

# Save Workspace
This concludes the QC script. Let's save the RData.
```{r savedata}
save.image(file = paste0(dirqc, project,"_QC.RData"))
```

# Save Document

Once you've run through this script and have added comments to the top, and after each section (project and QC data analysis), you can save the document. 

    1) File > Save (or Control + S or the little "Save" icon on the top bar)
    2) Navigate to the QC directory in Windows Explorer
    3) Rename the .nb.html to something informative e.g., "project#_QC_final.nb.html"
